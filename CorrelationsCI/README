This directory concerns 95% confidence intervals for correlated IDER parameters in an example used in Supplemenrary Information S5.
Generate_CorrelatedGamma_Alden.R is a script that generates and saves values for the 7 parameters (namely alpha0, alpha1, alpha2, lambda0, lambda0, lambda1, lambda2 and beta_p, where the distribution of beta_p is independent of the other distributions), with the correlation structure in the paper supplement. The data file that is generated from this script is named gamma_realistic.RData. RadResMainRKS5_RealisticCor_Alden.R loads the saved parameter values and generates the plot.
